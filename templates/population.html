								<h3>China's Population Projection (2015-2050)</h3>
							</header>

							<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
							<p>
								China is facing a complex trend of demographic change than the one in the 20th century. Recently, China’s population change shows some new trends, 
								such as accelerating up of aging and a low total fertility rate (TFR). All these factors affect China’s population growth. 
								This section describes a dynamic model for Chinese provincial population projection from 2015 to 2050, 
								considering indicators of population scale, birth rate of women in child-bearing age, and death rate, which are all categorized by age and sex.

							</p>
						
							<a name="Model">Dynamic model</a>
							<p>
									A population dynamic model is used to respond the question of how a population is 
									going to change in the future, given its current status and the conditions that 
									the population is exposed to. The two important characteristics of a population 
									for its future development are the total number of individuals in the population 
									and the composition of the population. The first term is referred as population size, 
									while the second is known as population structure. Together, these terms define the 
									population state or p-state. The p-state is the characterization of the population in 
									terms of how many individuals of which type (e.g. age, size, sex) are present in the population.

									The population dynamic model can be expressed with the following equation:
									<br>
									<center>Population change = Births − Deaths + Immigration – Emigration</center>
									<br>
									This equation reflects a balance in the population between processes that decrease its size (e.g. death and emigration) 
									and processes that increase its size (e.g. reproduction and immigration). Both immigration and emigration of individuals 
									can be neglected if the area in which the population is considered to live is closed off to any movement of individual across 
									its boundaries. In this case, population dynamics is just the balance between the number of birth and death cases of individuals.

								The components of population change (fertility and mortality) are projected for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year) beginning with an estimated based population for 2010. These projections are based on the birth and mortality rates reported in 2010 for each Chinese province. 
								In each iteration of the model (See Figure below) advanced one year of age. In this manner, a new birth cohort is added to the population by applying the projected age-specific fertility rates to the female population. Births, adjusted for infant mortality, form the new population under 
								one year of age. In summary, the cohort component method can be expressed as:

								Projections produced through the cohort component method are driven by assumptions regarding each of the components of change.

								In accordance with the current demographics conditions of China, this model matches the features of China’s population growth 
								and predicts population changes in the future. 
									
								On other hand, the under-five mortality rates reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2010 are below the values reported by the World Bank, 
								UN, and WHO. 
								The National Bureau of Statistics has reported figures for China are similar to rates of developed countries like Luxemburg, Switzerland, and Finland. 
								The data from National Bureau of Statistics of China was used because it is more accurate. 
								It is very unlikely that China will improve its under-five mortality rates, and there is no reason to believe that these rates will increase in the future. 
								For these reasons, the scenarios didn’t consider any changes in the under-five mortality rates.
									
								Finally, some other important findings are:
								<ul>
										<li>The model is very sensitive to changes in fertility rates.</li>
										<li>Under all the scenarios the population peak will be reached before 2050.</li>
								</ul>
